## Hello everyone, I'm James! ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently studying Graphic Information Technology at ASU and I hope to become a web developer after graduation. I'm looking for internships and entry-level web developing positions; please feel free to reach out to me on my LinkedIn: (www.linkedin.com/in/james-souder).  I enjoy the creative side of coding like designing in CSS. I have experience with a variety of coding languages, such as Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, and SQL. In my free time, I love to spend time with my family and friends, go to concerts, read horror novels, and play video games.
